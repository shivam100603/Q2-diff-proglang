        <h1>DIFFERENT PROGAMMING LANGUAGES</h1>
        <article id="Procedural">
            <h2>1. Procedural Programming Languages</h2>
            <p>A procedural language follows a sequence of statements or commands in
            order to achieve a desired output. Each series of steps is called a procedure,
            and a program written in one of these languages will have one or more procedures
            within it. Common examples of procedural languages include:
            <ul>
                <li>C and C++</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Pascal</li>
                <li>Basic</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        </article>

        <article id="Functional ">
            <h2>2. Functional programming languages</h2>
            <p>Rather than focusing on the execution of statements, functional
            languages focus on the output of mathematical functions and evaluations.
            Each function–a reusable module of code–performs a specific task and returns
            a result. The result will vary depending on what data you input into the function.
            Some popular functional programming languages include:
            <ul>
                <li>Scala</li>
                <li>Erlang</li>
                <li>Haskell</li>
                <li>Elixir</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </article>

        <article id="OOPs">
            <h2>3. Object-oriented programming languages (OOP)</h2>
            <p>This type of language treats a program as a group of objects composed
            of data and program elements, known as attributes and methods.
            Objects can be reused within a program or in other programs.
            This makes it a popular language type for complex programs,
            as code is easier to reuse and scale. Some common object-oriented languages include:
            <ul>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>PHP</li>
                <li>Ruby</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </article>

        <article id="Scripting">
            <h2>4. Scripting languages</h2>
            <p>Programmers use scripting languages to automate repetitive tasks,
            manage dynamic web content, or support processes in larger applications.
            Some common scripting languages include:
            <ul>
                <li>Bash</li>
                <li>Perl</li>
                <li>Node.js</li>
                <li>Ruby</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </article>

        <article id="Logic">
            <h2>5. Logic programming languages</h2>
            <p>Instead of telling a computer what to do, a logic programming language
            expresses a series of facts and rules to instruct the computer on how to
            make decisions. Some examples of logic languages include:
            <ul>
                <li>Prlog</li>
                <li>Absys</li>
                <li>Datalog</li>
                <li>Alma-0</li>
            </ul>
